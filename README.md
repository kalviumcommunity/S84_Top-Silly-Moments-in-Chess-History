### Project Overview:
 **"Top Silly Moments in Chess History"** project is a unique way to showcase a combination of technical as well as creative skills at  same time. By building this project, I can show skill in several important areas in full-stack web development.

## FRONT-END

1. **Component-Based Architecture:** I will learn how to design components to display user profiles, and individual moments. This helps to improve my understanding of front-end component.    
2. **UX Design:** I will focus on building an interactive UI where users can easily navigate through many videos and moments, rate them, and submit their own moments/videos or add comments to that moments / videos.
3.  **Routing & Navigation:** Using Js and react to navigate and design different views (e.g., login page, home page, user-specific list) will sharpen my skills.

## BACKEND

1.  **API Design:** I will create RESTful APIs for handling operations like Create, Read, Update, Delete for the chess moments, which can help in API design, request handling, and error management..
2. **Database Interaction (MongoDB & Mongoose):** I will design Mongoose schemas for storing user data , videos and moments. This will help my understanding of database schema design and how to interact with databases using API.

### Deployment:

1. I will deploy both the frontend and backend platforms like Netlify and Render, gaining experience with deployment and configuration.
2. By using GitHub to manage version control, I will gain a deeper understanding of collaborative development practices, including branching, pull requests, and merging.

## Data Security:
1. I will implement secure password handling by hashing passwords so that user sensitive information is stored in a safe place.
  
This project will help me gain practical experience with modern web development tools while simultaneously providing a fun and engaging platform for users to enjoy and interact with chess history and its silly moments. By completing this project, I will be able to demonstrate my skills in full-stack development, API design, database management, and user authentication.
